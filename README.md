## Getting Started
Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/Dynamic-Conditional-Networks-for-Few-Shot-Learning.pytorch.git
```

### Requirements

Tested under python3.

- python packages
  - pytorch>=0.3.1
  - Anaconda3
- An NVIDAI GPU and CUDA 8.0 or higher. Some operations only have gpu implementation.
- **NOTICE**: different versions of Pytorch package have different memory usages.
